# 📊 UrbanAura Project - Retail Sales Analysis

## 📝 Context
This project aims to analyze data generated in a fictitious retail store in Europe called **UrbanAura**, with information on customers, products, sales transactions, and stores in different locations. The data includes customer details (such as name, email, and registration date), product information (name, category, and price), store details (location and name), and sales (transaction details, quantity, and date).

This analysis provides an overview of sales, consumer behavior, and helps identify purchasing patterns that can be useful for optimizing retail strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis, used for loading, cleaning, and analyzing the data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for generating result graphs.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Tool for writing and running code in an interactive environment, making it easier to visualize results.

## 📈 Results Analysis
By combining this data, several actions can be performed, such as:
- Sales analysis by store, product category, or time period.
- Identifying consumption patterns, such as best-selling products or repeat customers.
- Calculation of KPIs such as average ticket, revenue by store or product category.
Based on the analysis of this data, reports on the profitability of stores or product categories can be generated. Visualizations provide a clear way to observe trends and make data-driven decisions.

## 📋 Conclusions
- This project aims to help retail businesses better understand their performance and make informed decisions about products, sales, and marketing. The data provides a clear view of which products and stores are most profitable, who the most loyal customers are, and how to improve the overall strategy to increase sales.

- In future stages, this analysis could be integrated with machine learning tools to predict future sales, optimize inventory, or personalize the customer experience.
